    <h1>ALL ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div id="myself" class="text">
        <p>Am a mother of five, all grown up adults now, three boys and two girls. One of my boys is presently a software developer, while another boy is currently doing masters in Computer information System. I live in Abuja, the Federal capital city of Nigeria.  I do not hold a job currently, that is one of the reasons I am interested in learning web development with Trendmasters, so I can have a marketable skill.</p><span>

        <p>I will love to know how to design a responsive and interactive website.  I get excited when I see beautiful forms in web pages, and nice table layouts.  I want to know more about all the navigations, the elements, attributes, tags, all the behind the scene things that make a website attractive. </p>

    <h2 class="description">Three things to know about me!</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>After high school in the seventies, I attended a Polytechnic where I studied Secretarial Administration, and got a National Diploma.  I joined the civil service as a Confidential Secretary.  I was sent on in service training to qualify as a Personal Secretary.  So, I worked with Permanent Secretaries and Commissioners in my state for ten years before voluntarily withdrawing to take care of my kids.</p>
        <p>For seventeen years, I became a stay-at-home mum, spending time training my children in the discipline and mental regulating of Jehovah.  I also share in volunteer work of teaching people love of neighbor, the planet and love of their creator.When my last kid was done with high school, I joined my son in his company, marketing solutions to government offices.</p>
        <p>I love to learn and adapt to new concepts.  I do not give up easily, and I believe in putting all my best to a venture.  I guess that is why my son introduced me to FrontendMasters.  I think there are no barriers, nor limits.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>    

        <p> I do have a few hobbies though, but am focusing on making homemade breaad.;
            <ul>
                <li>dress-making</li>
                <li>duvet-making</li>
                <li>cooking</li>
                <li>baking</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h2>Homemade Bread</h2>
        <p>From the start of the whole process, keeping ingredients together, the wet and dry ones, to mixing the dough is an interesting experience.  But what whips up the feeling of excitement and joy is watching the reaction of the whole family. The moment the dough is in the oven, it take about 20-25 minutes for the aroma to permeate the home, and even the outside.  The kids are all filled with excitement to gorge the oven fresh Homemade bread.  It gives me joy to watch all of them, suddenly competing for who will be the first to taste the bread.  That happens to be the small reward of moms who can spare a little time to provide home made meals for their families.</p>

        <p>I certainly haven't travelled because of baking bread.  But I have had cause to travel to Pennsylvania and Clinton Village to see my kids who were schooling both in Hamilton and BrynMawr Colleges.  On those occasions, I had to relive the experience for them, bake bread, scones and cake, and watch them still react as kids on the sight of the oven baked fresh bread.</p>

        <h2>Resuming my training</h2>
        <p>After about 3 weeks break, forced by my going to support mum to assembly, and then, my falling ill, and the visit of the circuit week, I finally resumed my training.  It was an uphill task trying to get back into the routine.  But, knowing what is at stake, I prayed to Jehovah for strength, and summoned courage to restart.</p>

        <h2>Learning CSS</h2>
        <p>I have learnt how to create a css folder right from the desktop, and save it into the html folder am working with.  But i noticed that the things am styling in the css sheet is not showing on my webpage.  So, I asked Emem what the issue was, and he showed me, I did not link it properly.  When the arrow is facing my right, it shows that the style.css file is not really in the css folder, but when the arrow is facing down, and the style.css is indended, it is properly done.  So, I clicked and dragged the style.css file into the css, and when I refreshed my page, wow! it was different. </p>
