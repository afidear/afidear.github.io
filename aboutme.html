        <h1>ALL ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Am a mother of five living in Abuja, the Federal capital city of Nigeria. I am interested in learning web development with Trendmasters, so I can have a marketable skill.</p><span>

        <p>I will love to know how to design a responsive and interactive website.  I get excited when I see beautiful forms in web pages, and nice table layouts.  I want to know more about all the navigations, the elements, attributes, tags, all the behind the scene things that make a website attractive. </p>

        <h2 class="description">My Mantra!</h2>
        
        <p>I love to learn and adapt to new concepts.  I do not give up easily, and I believe in putting all my best to a venture.  I think there are no barriers, nor limits.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>    

        <p> I do have a few hobbies though, but am focusing on making homemade breaad.;

        <h2>Homemade Bread</h2>
        <p>From the start of the whole process, keeping ingredients together, the wet and dry ones, to mixing the dough is an interesting experience.  But what whips up the feeling of excitement and joy is watching the reaction of the whole family. The moment the dough is in the oven, it take about 20-25 minutes for the aroma to permeate the home, and the surrounding. The kids are all filled with excitement to gorge the oven fresh Homemade bread.  It gives me joy to watch all of them, suddenly competing for who will be the first to taste the bread.  That happens to be the small reward of moms who can spare a little time to provide home made meals for their families.</p>

        <h2>Resuming my training</h2>
        <p>After about 3 weeks break, I finally resumed my training.  It was an uphill task trying to get back into the routine.  But, knowing what is at stake, I summoned courage to restart.</p>

        <h2>Learning CSS</h2>
        <p>I have learnt how to create a css folder right from the desktop, and save it into the html folder am working with. I have also learnt the use of flex, creating contact forms, nav bars, radio buttons, check boxes, etc </p>
